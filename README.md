### ▶︎Overview
This project aims to develop a system utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to verify that chemical substances meet regulatory standards while protecting sensitive information.

Ensuring that chemical substances comply with laws and regulations is crucial. However, disclosing detailed information about these substances poses risks in terms of intellectual property protection and maintaining competitive advantage. To address this issue, we are implementing a system that allows companies to securely prove that their chemical substances meet regulatory standards without revealing specific data, leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proof technology.

### ▶︎Problems
  
Consumers want to keep their allergy information private while still dining out safely. At the same time, restaurants prefer not to disclose their proprietary recipes while providing allergy-conscious services.
   
### ▶︎Solution

This issue can be resolved by using the Mina Protocol. Specifically, the chemical composition of recipes can be hashed, creating a unique identifier that does not reveal the actual substances. This allows restaurants to provide hashed lists of allergenic ingredients without disclosing their recipes, enabling consumers to safely enjoy their meals without revealing their allergy information.
