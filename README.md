## zk-compounds

### ▶︎Overview
This project develops a system using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to verify that chemical substances comply with regulations while safeguarding sensitive information. The system enables companies to prove regulatory compliance without disclosing detailed data, protecting intellectual property and competitive advantage.

### ▶︎Problems
  
Consumers want to keep their allergy information private while still dining out safely. At the same time, restaurants prefer not to disclose their proprietary recipes while providing allergy-conscious services.
   
### ▶︎Solution

This issue can be resolved by using the Mina Protocol. Specifically, the chemical composition of recipes can be hashed, creating a unique identifier that does not reveal the actual substances. This allows restaurants to provide hashed lists of allergenic ingredients without disclosing their recipes, enabling consumers to safely enjoy their meals without revealing their allergy information.
